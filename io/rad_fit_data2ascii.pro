; NAME: 
; RAD_FIT_DATA2ASCII
;
; PURPOSE: 
; This procedure writes fitACF data into a ASCII file. It creates one file
; per beam, putting the coordinates of the beam/gate cells at the beginning
; of the file.
;
; INPUTS:
; Date: A scalar or 2-element vector giving the date range to output, 
; in YYYYMMDD or MMMYYYY format.
;
; Radar: The three letter code of the radar for which to output data.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; TIME: A 2-element vector giving the time range to plot, in HHII format.
;
; LONG: Set this keyword to indicate that the TIME value is in HHIISS
; format rather than HHII format.
;
; PARAM: Set this keyword to specify the parameter to plot. Allowable
; values are 'power', 'velocity', and 'width'. Default is 'power'.
;
; BEAMS: Set this keyword to an array of beam numbers to output.
;
; CHANNEL: Set this keyword to the channel number you want to output.
;
; SCAN_ID: Set this keyword to the numeric scan id you want to output.
;
; COORDS: Set this keyword to a string naming the coordinate system
; of the radar cell positions. Allowable inputs are 'magn' and 'geog'.
;
; OUTDIR: Set this keyword to a string naming the directory in which
; to output the file(s). Make sure you have write access. Default is ./
;
; IGNORE_GSCATTER: Set this keyword to not print data marked as ground scatter.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
; RAD_DATA_BLK: The common block holding the currently loaded radar data and 
; information about that data.
