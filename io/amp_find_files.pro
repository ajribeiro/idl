; NAME: 
; AMP_FIND_FILES
;
; PURPOSE: 
; This function returns AMPERE files that fall in the given time interval.
; 
; CATEGORY: 
; Input/Output
; 
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
; Result = AMP_FIND_FILES(Date)
;
; INPUTS:
; Date: The date of which to read data. Can be a scalar in YYYYMMDD format or
; a 2-element vector in YYYYMMDD format.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
; HEMISPHERE: Set this keyword to 1 to look for map potentail files for the norther hemisphere
; set it to -1 to look for files of the southern hemisphere.
;
; TIME: The time range for which to read data. Must be a 2-element vector in 
; HHII format, or HHIISS format if the LONG keyword is set. If TIME is not set
; the default value [0000,2400] is assumed.
;
; LONG: Set this keyword to indicate that the Time value is in HHIISS
; format rather than HHII format.
;
; SILENT: Set this keyword to surpress warnings but not error messages.
;
; PATH: Set this to a directory name in which to look for the AMPERE files.
; The default is to use the output from AMP_GET_PATH().
;
; FILE_COUNT: Set this to a named variable that will contain the number
; of files found for the given time interval.
;
; PROCEDURE:
; If Date is a scalar
; and Time[0] < Time[1], the interval stretches from Time[0] on Date to Time[1] 
; on Date. If Time[0] > Time[1], the interval stretches from Time[0] on Date to
; Time[1] on the day after Date. If Date is a two element vector, the interval
; stretches from Time[0] on Date[0] to Time[1] on Date[1].
